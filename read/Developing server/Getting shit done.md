Figuring out what the network does
========================================

There comes a point where you realize that you might as well read the whole code and realize you haven't done anything besides learning tons of important details about the internals.

However we want to create a server NOW, not after we rediscover the whole game logic, this section was done due to the sheer frustation I had while trying to make the server, also because niggest doesn't care about understanding the code but just getting shit done.

Reverse Engineering?
