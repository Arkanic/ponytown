A bit of history
------------------
As far as I know, no one has understood the whole code of pony.town other than Agmentizar, and probably they don't even know how it fully works, due to the use other frameworks.

So far we've "reverse engineered" the game, by listening to the server requests, and sends, and setting some breakpoints here and there.

Altdev managed to make a copy of pony-town server as "proof" that it can be done, but so far he doesn't have time or desire to mantain the server, I wouldn't know his motives for it.

I managed, to copy blackjacktown server code, I saw some "hacks" posted on /mlp/ threads, where you could do crazy stuff, like teleportation, walking when standing, or just very big boxes, also, null grass.

Bootsy was the first one that wanted to re-make the game, but everyone agreed that the code was a complete mess.

Well, this is my first attempt to understand the complexity of pony.town code, bear with me, into the unknown...
